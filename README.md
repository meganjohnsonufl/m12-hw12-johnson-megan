## Struggles With Assignment ##
I openly struggled trying to get the grids to work in my favor. I watched all the lectures and read all the different resources, but I felt like it was still hard to translate. It took contacting the instructor towards the end and some help from a classmate to get the assignment completed. I got confused with grid areas and getting the columns and rows to work how I wanted them to work.
